            I am a front-end developer in Cheshire, Crewe with a 2:1 bachelors
            degree in Graphic Design. I started my coding journey about a year
            ago when I became increasingly interested in the "behind the scenes"
            of my graphic design projects. I knew how to design websites,
            publications and other media from a design software package but I
            wanted to jump into learning how to effectively build them with
            code. <br />
            How did I get here? I began experimenting with basic HTML and CSS
            during my time at university, however, I knew that I wanted to take
            my passion further and that's when I started a coding course, called
            SheCodes.
